# cifar10
This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to recognize 10 object categories, including airplanes, cats, and cars. Leveraging TensorFlow, data augmentation, and optimization techniques, the project achieves high accuracy.
