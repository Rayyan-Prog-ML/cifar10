# CIFAR-10 Image Recognition using CNN 🚀

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The dataset consists of **60,000 images** across **10 categories**, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.

## Dataset 📂
- **Name:** CIFAR-10  
- **Size:** 60,000 images (50,000 training + 10,000 testing)  
- **Classes:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck  
- **Image Size:** 32x32 pixels (RGB)  

## Model Architecture 🏗️
The CNN model includes:  
✅ **Convolutional Layers** – Extract spatial features  
✅ **Max Pooling Layers** – Reduce dimensions  
✅ **Batch Normalization** – Speed up training  
✅ **Dropout Layers** – Prevent overfitting  
✅ **Dense Layers** – Final classification  

## Installation & Setup ⚙️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-image-recognition.git
   cd cifar10-image-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Results & Accuracy 📊
- Achieved **X% accuracy** on test data.
- Model evaluation with loss and accuracy plots.
